2005-09-15  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* NEWS: Updated for release.
	* Makefile: updated for release.
	* Makefile.kernel: updated for release

2005-09-12  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* locks.c: Removed locking code since its broken big define 0 around
	it
	* file.c: Removed locking references have the vfs handle it.
	* unionfs.h: fixed bug with 2.4 compilation.

2005-09-08  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c: Remove comment leftover from templates that doesn't make
	sense in current context.

2005-09-05  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* commonfops.c: Remove lower fput debug printks.

2005-09-02  Shaya Potter <spotter@cs.columbia.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_mmap): Fix flag checking for mmap.

2005-09-01  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* We shouldn't use d_delete, vfs_unlink already does it.  The only
	known remaining 2.6.13 issue is the unionfs_lock (flock.sh in the
	regression suite).

	* inode.c,stale_inode.c: Support for 2.6.13's new follow_link prototype.
	However, many of the regression tests fail for unrelated reasons (or at
	least I think they are unrelated).

	* unionctl.c: Allow --FOO to go before the union specifier (e.g.,
	unionctl --list /mnt/unionfs now works).
	* lookup.c: Don't partial lookup the root dentry.

	* copyup.c: Check for permission setting errors.

2005-08-31  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* lookup_one_len never returns NULL.

2005-08-30  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_permission): Simplified code.

	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Copy directory attrs to directory (BUG391).
	Unfortunately, regression test doesn't quite catch the bug because of a
	revalidate for the stat.
	* commit: Don't complain about .sh file's indentation.

2005-08-29  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
	
	* INSTALL: tmpfs doesn't support fsync on directories

	* Makefile: Update release target for new directory structure.

	* patch-kernel.sh: Depend on Experimental, and move configuration option
	to File Systems -> Miscellaneous file systems at the end, not as the
	very first file system. Add UNIONFS_VERSION define.  Use tail -n +7
	instead of tail +7.

	* file.c (unionfs_fsync): Don't use dtohd on unlocked dentries.

2005-08-28  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Don't use unionfs_interpose with
	INTERPOSE_LINK any more, because only one line of the whole function
	was being used anyway.  This fixes an inode refcount leak in
	unionfs_link, so the regression suite now passes with the new locking,
	without any leaks.

	* commonfops.c (unionfs_file_release): Update rdstate access time when
	saving it in the inode (so that it won't be so quickly discarded).

2005-08-26  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* dirfops.c (unionfs_readdir) : removed the changes made
	for the special way in which vfs_llseek was handles for
	Reiser4, as Reiser4 introduced a patch which made it
	behave properly.

2005-08-26  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Passes regression tests.

	* Locking for create_parents.  Regression tests from branchman to
	open.sh PASS.

	* Basic inode operations pass sniff test with new locking (regression
	tests not yet tried).

	* Dentries need locking, and there isn't much way around it.This
	snapshot adds some untested locking, and you won't want to use it
	yet.  The basic principles are:
		1. As soon as a VFS operation that touches a dentry is entered,
		the dentry should be locked.
		2. The lock ordering is:
			Children before parents
			Two children are tie broken with their address
	There are several functions not done yet, most notably create_parents,
	because it is going to require more thought (we walk up the parent
	list and then back down it).  This in part is why children need to go
	before parents (also revalidate walks up the parent list).

2005-08-25  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* xattr.c: unused label causing a warning and inturn an error.

2005-08-25  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c (interpose,reinterpose): Interposition should lock the dentry.

	* file.c: CodingStyle, and we don't need to check ftopd before ftohf.
	* file.c (unionfs_mmap): We were checking our file instead of the lower
	-level file for having valid operations.
	* dirfops.c,dirhelper.c: CodyingStyle

	* copyup.c: There is no need for _len at the end of functions, because
	other versions don't exist any longer.

	* lookup.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Lock the dentry private data
	for the whole lookup routine.
	* branchman.c: CodingStyle fixes.
	* rdstate.c, super.c: Use KERN_ERR if we have unfreed objects.

2005-08-25  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* INSTALL: Fix losetup instructions.

2005-08-24  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* rdstate.c,dirfops.c: Code style cleanups.

2005-08-24  Anton Farygin  <rider@altlinux.com>

	* dentry.c (d_revalidate):  Lock inode when freeing lower level ones.

2005-08-24  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
	* unionfs.h: Updated forwardmap version and added a new data
	structure bmapent.(Later on these should be unified into one header
	rather than being in 2 header files).
	* persistant_inode.c: Updated code to use bmapents now.

2005-08-24  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionimap.c: Added code to ensure you dont add a filesystem with
	the same fsid twice (no duplicate entries in the maps).
	* unionimap.h: Added a new data structrue bmapent.
	* The code in the kernel to read the maps hasent been changed so it
	doesent work yet. Check back soon for that.

2005-08-24  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): Use proper permissions when recreating
	a deleted file (BUG383).

2005-08-23  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* commonfops.c (copyup_deleted_file): Fix leak of name on subsequent
	loop iterations.

	* commonfops.c (copyup_deleted_file): Cleanup of major loop.

	* unionfs.h (DPUT,KFREE): Don't try to free errors.

	* main.c (unionfs_reinterpose): Remove d_unhashed assertion.
	* unionfs.h (d_deleted): Create an inline function to tell
	if a directory is deleted (i.e., unhashed and not the root).

2005-08-23  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): More checking for copyupmode.

2005-08-22  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>
	
	* unionfs.h (get_nlinks): More intelligent link counting.

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): Don't dput an IS_ERR.

	* unionfs.h: sbstart is always zero
	* main.c (unionfs_read_super): check_branch does existence checking

	* unionfs_debugmacros.h: Fix stray printks.

	The following fixes are so that the regression suite runs without
	any memory or dentry leaks:
	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_addbranch): Zero newly allocated
	arrays.
	* copyup.c (unionfs_create_named_dirs): Fix leak of path stack.
	* main.c: Handle get_parent.

	* INSTALL: sendfile conflicts w/ Unionfs.

2005-08-19  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* dirfops.c (unionfs_readdir) : changed the way the 
	return value of the repeated vfs_llseek (with origin
	=1) is used. this is to allow readdir in Reiser4,
	which returns -ENOENT (!!!) for the llseek in same
	cases. this is for Bug #358

2005-08-18  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* match-dget.pl: Insert both gets and puts into list of actions
	for unreleased dentries.

	* match-dget.pl: Dget matching script.
	* Use DGET, DPUT, DENTRY_OPEN, and LOOKUP_ONE_LEN to

	memory allocation fails.

2005-08-12  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* rename.c, commonfops.c : removed the
	dget/dput functions sandwiching the vfs_unlink as
	these raise the refcounts and cause the .nfsXYZ
	files to get created after unlinks. This knocks
	out Bug#364 for 2.6.

2005-08-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_revalidate): All exit paths should go through
	out.

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options,unionfs_parse_dirs): Simplified
	option parsing using strsep rather than direct pointer manipulation.
	Organized the options into types to factor out common code.

2005-08-09  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* debian/*: Use official debian packaging files.

	* commonfops.c (unionfs_flush) : corrected the d_unhashed check

2005-08-04  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* branchman.c (QUERY): Don't copy FD_SET before ioctl. FD_ZERO the
	set before the call.

2005-08-03  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_release) : added a check to take care
	of the case when the dentry coming into release is from a

	is a fix for bug 323

	* rename.c (unionfs_rename_all) : changed the whiteout
	creation call to "create_whiteout" instead of the
	"create_whiteout_parent". this must solve 332.

	to above to correct #336.

2005-07-20  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	since it will always be 2 since we are using the root of the fs.

2005-06-24  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Makefile: added usercommon.c into the make targets
	* usercommon.c: Moves find_union to here and fixed it up

	* unionimap.h: added extern for mkfsid
	* persistent_inode.c: fixed some bugs
	* unionctl.c: removed find_union from here and updated calls to it.

	bug #294.

2005-06-22  Arun M. Krishnakumar  <arunmk@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* commonfops.c (unionfs_open): If the highest-priority branch

	calls to use the maps.

2005-06-17  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* persistent_inode.c: it appears that parse_imap_options is working

	* unlink.c: Empty a directory of its whiteouts before deleting it,
	and refresh the hidden dentry on a failed rmdir.

	* unionfs.h: Always include ufi_file_i, so we can compile with zero
	inline entries if we want.

	* Test commit.

	* Makefile: Define UNIONFS_VERSION to be the current version.
	* main.c: Print the version of Unionfs, not main.c.

2005-05-17  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* lookup.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Fix partial lookups for
	three or more branches.

	* lookup.c (new_dentry_private_data): Fix memset'ing logic.
	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_addbranch): Fix copying logic.

	* inode.c(unionfs_follow_link): Return 0 not the number of bytes
	in follow_link.

	* Reduce Unionfs module size when NODEBUG is set by not compiling
	print.c, and using a different set of macros that don't require
	__FILE__, __FUNCTION__, and __LINE__, and don't do as much checking
	because we've aleady turned ASSERT off.

	* Support for inline objects, so that we don't need more
	than one allocation for inodes and only two for dentries (the dentry
	itself and its private data).

	* Separate directory file operations from normal file operations.

2005-05-13  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Makefile: Increment version number.

	* Makefile: Release 1.0.12

2005-05-13  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: Disable generic_file_sendfile, because it causes nfsd
	to Oops.

	* lookup.c (unionfs_lookup): Don't ASSERT dentry goodness along
	the error path.
	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_release): Handle dentries without dthod_ptrs.

2005-05-11  Jaspreet Singh  <jsingh@ensim.com>

	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): Move fist_copy_attr_all before

	* persistent_inode.c : fixed typo for compilation

2005-05-12  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	of the file.

2005-05-12  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* persistant_inode.c : Functions needed to establish and maintain
	a persistant inode scheme for unionfs.
	* main.c : modified parse options for persistant inodes. Not done yet

2005-05-11  Jaspreet Singh  <jsingh@ensim.com>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_xattrs): Don't use XATTR_CREATE,

	(Selinux automatically creates attributes.

2005-05-11  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* print.c (fist_print_generic_dentry): ASSERT(d_count > 0) so
	that we find dentries gone bad earlier rather than later.

	* inode.c (unionfs_mkdir): bend should not go past the opaque
	directory, but stay there.

2005-05-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* INSTALL: Add root file system instructions based on Linux
	Live's linuxrc.

2005-05-08  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c,super.c,lookup.c: Use alloc_inode in 2.6, so that only
	two allocations need to be made per inode instead of two.  In
	both 2.4 and 2.6 use a private kmem_cache for our dentry data,
	so that we don't need to waste space by having kmalloc round up.

	* lookup.c (new_dentry_private_data): Merge initialization and
	reinitialization code from lookup and read_super.  Also don't
	reallocate dentry private data if we already have enough space.

	* INSTALL: Add Jaspreet Singh's selinux instructions.

	* INSTALL: Add EXDEV on ro branch rename as a limitation.

	* inode.c: follow_link and put_link fix for 2.6.

	* lookup.c: Compile fix for 2.4.

	* rename.c: If a directory is moved on a read-only branch return EXDEV,

	would be too ugly).

2005-05-06  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* lookup.c: Merge unionfs_lookup_backend and unionfs_partial_lookup,
	partial lookups will now properly handle whiteouts.

	* lookup.c: Fix BUG 264.
	* print.c: Separate generic inode printing from itohi printing.
	Use const for print functions.

2005-05-05  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Code style fixes.

2005-04-27  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c: Move unionfs_partial_lookup to lookup.c.
	* inode.c: Move unionfs_lookup to lookup.c:

	* rename.c: Don't print lower-level dentries using a Unionfs
	specific function.

	* print.c: Divide fist_print_dentry into one function for Unionfs
	specific dentries, and then a generic function.  Also ASSERT that
	we are really printing a Unionfs dentry (so we don't dereference
	bad private data).

	* Fix indentation comments.

2005-04-25  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c: Code style fixes.

2005-04-22  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* NEWS: Keep NEWS up to date.

2005-04-21  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_filldir): Don't strncmp for .wh., if the
	name's length is less than 4.  Old cruft can make things
	go horribly bad (BUG 254).

	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Properly handle file
	transitioning from a negative to a positive dentry. (BUG 215)

2005-04-21  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: Sendfile only exists on 2.6.
	* main.c: Catch UNIONFS_REVAL_NEG specifically, still
	need to understand/fix.

2005-04-20  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c (unionfs_partial_lookup) ,unionfs.h
	(unionfs_dentry_info), inode.c(unionfs_lookup):
	Correctly mark a directory as opaque and respect that
	during partial lookups.

	* Exorcise struct typedefs and "fake" STATIC functions.

	* inode.c: Experimental support for opaque directories,
	not all of the loose ends are tied up, so this snapshot
	will have some associated oddities.

	* xattr.c: Use EOPNOTSUPP, not ENOTSUPP.

	* Makefile, unionfs.h: Separation of rename/unlink code.
	* rename.c: Separate rename code from inode.c
	* unlink.c: Separate unlink code from inode.c

2005-04-20  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* rdstate.c, unionfs.h: DOH, We were checking if
	uii_rdversion <= MAXRDCOOKIE to decide whether or not
	to wrap uii_cookie.

2005-04-19  Fabian Franz  <fs-bugs@fabian-franz.de>

	* applied patch to file.c that uses generic_file_sendfile
	to implement sendfile.

2005-04-18  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* copyup.c: Extended attributes now copyup properly.
	This has only been tested in 2.6 but I see no reason
	that it shouldent work in 2.4
	* copyup.c: unionfs_create_dirs is now nolonger bound
	by MAX_DIRS_CREATE. We now use kmalloc to dynamically
	allocate memory for it and "realloc" the memory when
	needed.

2005-04-18  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* copyup.c: Use list_size as the argument to xattr_free, not the
	MAX_LIST_SIZE.

	* file.c: ASSERT was asserting on the dentry, not the i_mode.

2005-04-16  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: Delay copyup of read-write files located on read-only
	branches, until an operation will actually write to them (BUG 225).

	* INSTALL: Cleanup kernel instructions a bit.

2005-04-13  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	file for more details.
	* Makefile: PHONY added to the utils target to aid in building them
	for the kernel.

	duplicate super blocks are not factored into the calculations and
	all the block sizes are normalized to the first partition.

2005-03-14  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c (unionfs_read_super) : In 2.4 the kernel expects a valid

	caused an Oops. This has been fixed.

2005-03-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs_getlk (unionfs_getlk): Add preprocessor define for

	call the lower d_delete).  Thanks to Fabian Franz for identifying
	this issue.

2005-02-22  Fabian Franz  <fs-bugs@fabian-franz.de>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): Applied patch provided

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_xattrs): Use PASSERT, other compile fixes.
	* xattr.c (xattr_alloc, xattr_free): Shouldn't be static.
	* Go back to GFP_KERNEL, because GFP_NOFS causes problems with vserver.

2005-02-08  Jaspreet Singh  <jsingh@ensim.com>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_xattrs): Use security functions.

2005-02-08  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_xattrs): Take the inode lock as is done in
	setxattr.
	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Reference counting on error paths/compile fix.

2005-02-07  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_link): On copyup path directory was not unlocked.

2005-02-07  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_xattr_copyup): Review of code, not yet tested.

	* inode.c (unionfs_link): Revert to Chip's version of
	unionfs_link.

2005-02-07  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Makefile: Allow module prefixes to be specified for
	RPM_BUILD_ROOT
	* rpm/unionfs.spec: Compiled, tested, and installed.

2005-02-06  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Makefile added a target for uninstall to accomodate rpm removal

2005-02-02  Anton Farygin  <rider@altlinux.com>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_permissions): Use ATTR_FORCE to make
	sure any user can change permissions.
	* copyup.c (unionfs_create_dirs): Twiddle current->fsuid/fsgid
	so that any user's copyup will behave properly.

2005-02-02  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_mmap): Don't ASSERT that the lower mmap
	operation is there, instead return ENODEV, as is done in
	do_mmap_pgoff.  NTFS (and others) don't support mmap, so
	neither should we when stacked on top.

2005-02-01  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* dirhelper.c : fixed 2.6 compilation. call to vfs_creat missing
	last param in 2.6

	* Makefile : namei.c is no longer needed so it was removed from
	the make file.

2005-01-28  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c, dirhelper.c: Move mkdir/rmdir helpers into separate
	file.

	* unionfs.h, fist.h: Remove unused/redundant definitions.

2005-01-26  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* rdstate.c, unionfs.h: Move finding and adding filldir nodes
	into rdstate.c.  This reduced the readdir code size, and should
	also let us reuse the code for the subr.c functions.
	* subr.c: Use an rdstate instead of a second readdir to remove
	files in delete_whiteouts.
	* namei.c: Removed vfs_unlink_nozombie.

2005-01-19  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* INSTALL: Add more CFLAGS options to make things smaller.

	* unionfs.h, file.c, rdstate.c: Change DIREOF from -1 to 2^31-1 to
	fix readdir.

	* unionctl.c: Don't strip trailing slash for "/" when searching for
	the Union.

	* Makefile: Include INSTALL.

2005-01-14  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_addbranch): Fix error path resource leak.

2005-01-14  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* copyup.c (unionfs_copyup_permissions): Changed so it actually works now
	instead of corrupting certian bits.
	* copyup.c (unionfs_create_dirs): Function actually uses unionfs_copyup_permissions
	for setting directory permissions instead of setting them explicitly.

2005-01-14  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_dir_llseek): Allow llseek to the current
	offset in the directory, but nowhere else.
	* file.c (unionfs_readdir): Save the last offset, so we
	can lseek to it (for pretend).

	* Remove all occurrences of GFP_KERNEL and replace with GFP_NOFS,
	so our allocations can't cause file system calls.

2005-01-13  Rakesh N. Iyer  <riyer@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_readdir): Fixed deadlock in rdstate search.

2005-01-13  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Split README into INSTALL as well.

	* Makefile: Spit out a message saying to read install.

	* Don't build xattr functions w/o -DUNIONFS_XATTR

2005-01-11  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: Initial implementation of hardlinking a file on a read only branch.
	  Attributes are not copied properly yet.

2005-01-10  Sai Suman  <suman@pantasys.com>

	* copyup.c: Fix usage of unionfs_copyup_permissions.

2005-01-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* super.c: 2.4 compile fixes

	* fist.h: Updated FISTBUG for gcc 2.9.5

2005-01-10  David P. Quigley  <dquigley@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* xattr.c: Format changes for size_t.

	* doit.sh: Call optional postdoit script

2005-01-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* AUTHORS file.

	* README updates.

	* Allow NFS exports on 2.6 (Sai Suman)
	* Fixes to print format in xattr.c (Sai Suman)

	* debian/*: Debian packaging from Alex de Landgraaf.

	* Remove -Wno-unused-label for gcc 2.9.5 (alex@delandgraaf.com).
	* Allow "EXTRACFLAGS=-DNODEBUG" in fistdev.mk to disable
	the printing/ASSERT facility, cutting object size in half.

2005-01-09  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h: Warn when compiling on unsupported kernels.
	* super.c: Compile fix for 2.6.8.
	* Makefile: Include ChangeLog in the release.

2005-01-07  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Prepare 1.0.6 release.

	* Fix 2.6 compile issues in new code.

	* rdstate.c: Move readdir state away from subr.c.
	Use a kmem_cache for filldir nodes.

	* copyup.c: Move copyup functions away from subr.c

2005-01-06  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: Working NFS readdir.  On close we store left-over
	readdir state in the inode for up to 5 seconds.  If a readdir
	has a matching cookie, then we pull the state out of the inode
	and use it.  We also needed to use our own offsets, otherwise
	the NFS client got confused.

	* subr.c: Remember the number of entries in our hash table for
	each inode, and use that as the number for the next readdir.

	* Makefile: Fix dependencies on .h files.

	* print.c: Consistencify printing of files and superblocks
	and shorten some overly verbose output that added no information,
	but reduced the effective kernel log size.

	* fist.h: Make gcc check fist_dprint_internal formats.

	* file.c,unionfs.h: Separate readdir state into a separate structure.

	* file.c,unionfs.h,subr.c: Make readdir state use variable sized
	hash tables based on number of pages in lower-level directories.

	* Makefile: Install unionfs.ko, not unionfs.o if it exists.

	* main.c: Remove MODULE_PARM because it is deprecated.

2005-01-04  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_read): Fix "inifite" cat bug on 2.6

	* Makefile: Auto-select 2.4 vs. 2.6 for build.

	* Unify 2.4 and 2.6 Makefiles

	* Fixes for printing file structures at debug level 18.

	* Fixes for 2.4 compilation.

2004-12-30  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* *.[ch]: Update year.

2004-12-29  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: Embed rename.txt into comment.

2004-12-29  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c, unionfs.h: Changed directory copyup function back to
	old prototype.

	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): Handle directories, devices,
	and symlinks.

2004-12-27  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: Only request copyup of parent directories.

	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): Handle directory copyup
	(required for chmod).

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): Fix along error path.

2004-12-06  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): Allow mount point crossing.

	* README, Makefile, inode.c: Turn off extended attributes, unless
	the user specifically turns them back on by defining UNIONFS_XATTR.
	This prevents us from getting various compile errors depending on
	vendor-specific patches.

2004-11-10  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* Fix .cvsignore and release.

	* README: Added warning that anything less than 2.4.20 is unsupported.

	* namei.c: Removed inode_dir_notify calls when we are on less than
	2.4.20, because the symbol is not exported.

	* Fixed lots of bad casts from pointer to int in printks.

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): Fix for badly ordered variables.

	* main.c (unionfs_read_super): Remove double free along error path.

	* wrapfs.h (dtopd_lhs): Remove cast from LHS of assignments.

2004-11-09  Erez Zadok  <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* released unionfs-1.0.2.

	* README (site): fix typo. missing "`".

	* Makefile (clean): remove tarball.

	* README: updated.

2004-11-09  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* released unionfs-1.0.1.

	* Makefile: Include man pages in the release.

2004-11-07  Erez Zadok  <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* released unionfs-1.0.

	* announce-email.txt: revised announcement text.

2004-09-23  Erez Zadok  <ezk@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* announce-email.txt: draft announcement email.

	* README: revised.

2004-09-15  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: Don't allocate directory hash table for files.

	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): Don't do partial lookup if setattr is not
	set to all (should improve delete_whiteout).

	* Some grayout code (we don't discuss rename_first anymore, so it
	actually doesn't matter).

2004-08-24  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* namei.c (vfs_create_nozombie): Whiteout creation needs a version
	of vfs_create that won't down the i_zombie.

	* subr.c (create_dir_whs_filldir):  Don't ASSERT that the whiteout
	doesn't already exist, because we can have multiple files with
	the same name in other branches.

2004-08-23  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_mkdir, unionfs_symlink, unionfs_mknod): lookup
	whiteout in 'bstart' not 'bindex'. We always looked up on first branch
	as bindex was set to 0

2004-08-20  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): Walk up the tree to revalidate
	inodes like we do for dentries.

	* inode.c, subr.c, unionfs.h: Use multilocks to protect against
	unionfs_partial_lookup and revalidate operations racing against
	each other.

	* unionfs.h: Implementation of "multilocks".

	* Makefile: install target

	* We don't change size, so no sca_*.[ch] files.

	* main.c (unionfs_hidden_dentry_index): This function is unused now
	that Mohammad took it out, so I removed it.

	* Removed unnecessary files.

	* COPYING: SUNY we can't be blamed for anything notice; and the GPL.

2004-08-19  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): using dtohd_index() instead of
	unionfs_hidden_dentry() because an intermediate hidden dentry
	could be NULL and we dont want PASSERT to oops on us

2004-08-19  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink_all): We shouldn't have negative dentries
	unless they are the first one.

	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): PASSERT(hidden_inode) instead
	of Oopsing.

	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): Typo in the clobbering unlink.

	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): No debug printks.

	* unionfs.h (get_nlinks): Don't sum up non-directories.

	* subr.c (unionfs_refresh_hidden_dentry): Re-lookup a dentry, this
	is needed on rename reverts because vfs_rename trashes the dentry
	of the target.

	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): Working revert.

2004-08-18  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): New rename that handles more cases,
	revert code doesn't work yet.

2004-08-18  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (rmdir_all): exit if error is not -EROFS and not -ENOTEMPTY

	* inode.c (rmdir_all): exit from function and dont create whiteout
	if vfs_rmdir returns error other than -EROFS


2004-08-17  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink_all): Unlock the directory on error.

	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): Lock on all attribute changes, not just
	some.

	* inode.c (do_rename): Check renames based on index rather than
	new_dentry which might not exist.

	* Makefile: debugging symbols are very useful for Oops tracing

	* unionfs.h (CUR_MAX_BRANCH): Removed CUR_MAX_BRANCH which was always
	sbend + 1, and replaced with sbmax (that doesn't require a redundant
	and possbly inconsistent field within the super-block).

	* unionfs.h (dtopd): Converted from a macro to an inline function
	so that we can do more checking of the private data that we are
	returning.

	* unionfs.h (dtohd_index) Added a udi_bcount field to the private data
	so we would Oops rather than silently overflow array bounds.

	* dentry.c: Recursively revalidate the parent (the ASSERT that was
	checking this was mis-written).  It turns out that our parent was not
	always valid.

	* file.c (unionfs_file_revalidate): Always reassign the read-ahead
	values because the older file might have different values and llseek
	will cause an assertion failure.

	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup_backend): Treat revalidated negative and
	positive dentries differently.

2004-08-16  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: Use an fd_set instead of an integer for tracking successful
	renames.

	* branchman.c: Don't allow more than FD_SETSIZE (1024) branches.

	* unionctl.c: Specific message for exceeding FD_SETSIZE.

2004-08-11  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: Return ENAMETOOLONG when looking up ".wh.*"

	* unionctl.c: Add ioctl.

	* branchman.c: Don't allow branches without MAY_READ

	* unionctl.c: Convert branch pathnames into index automatically.

	* unionctl.c: Match the longest prefix of our path inside of
	/proc/mounts instead of the path itself.  This is required so that
	remove doesn't need to open the root of the union.

	* unionctl.c: Remove branch ioctl and list branch configuration.

2004-08-10  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: added CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks before calling unionfs ioctls

	* uniondbg.c: now contains debugging related ioctls

	* unionctl.c: now contains ioctls to add, remove and set branch
	permissions moved here

	* uniondbg.c: ioctls to add, remove and set branch permissions
	moved here

	* fist_ioctl.c: remaining ioctls stay here

	* subr.c: making sure copyupuid, copyupgid and copyupmode are all
	specified when copyup option is set to mounter.

	* inode.c: implemented unionfs_rename_first()

2004-08-09  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: more places where we should exit if get an error other than
	-EROFS in unlink/rmdir and related functions.

	* subr.c: exit if get an error other than -EROFS when
	creating/deleting whiteouts

	* inode.c: making sure that we create/mkdir/symlink/mknod to the
	left only if the error returned is -EROFS, otherwise passup

	* subr.c: use notify_change instead of directly modifying the inode
	fields.

	* subr.c: use notify_change instead of directly modifying the inode
	fields.

	* main.c: added copyupuid, copyupgid and copyupmode mount options.
	These options will specify the mode, uid and gid of copied-up files.
	copyup option should be set to mounter.

	* subr.c: using the above mount time values for copied-up files.

	* unionfs.h added these values in the unionfs super block.

2004-06-17  Charles P. Wright <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_flush): Flush all branches (only makes a
	difference for directories).

2004-08-03  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* super.c: Implemented unionfs_show_options. Can now view unionfs
	mount time options in /proc/mounts

	* inode.c: using is_robranch_super instead of is_robranch in
	create, mkdir, symlink, mknod operations, whenever we try to
	remove whiteouts if they exist.

	* main.c: while parsing options using strcmp wherever we can,
	removed all magic numbers, copyup options are now preserve,
	currentuser, mounter

	* subr.c: when copying up the default mode should be original
	owner (preserve)

2004-08-02  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair  <zubair@filer.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c: unionfs mount time flag changed from being an integer
	flag to several text options that will together make up the flag.

2004-05-17  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* branchman.c: Fixed off by one error when adding more than 8
	branches.

2004-05-10  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c (unionfs_read_super): Error check to prevent oops on bad
	mount-time options.

2004-04-21  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: revalidate files when the are passed into our methods,
	this allows copy-up of open files.  Yeah snapshots.

	* dentry.c: Should not use d_hash and d_compare because Unionfs is
	in charge of the namespace, not the lower-level file systems.

	* Unionfs now has split-view caches.  If compiled with
	-DSPLIT_VIEW_CACHES, then Unionfs supports duplicating the super
	block structure and dynamically selecting the correct structure to
	use when crossing into the unionfs mountpoint.  Right now the
	default behavior is that root has one view, and every other user
	has another view.

	If the super block is not duplicated then everything works as
	before.

2004-04-20  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* branchman.c: Super Duper works!  An ioctl can let you create a
	super block that is a copy of the original.  When you stat the
	mountpoint that super block is returned.  Now to fix the reference
	counting bugs associated with unmount. :)

2004-04-19  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@arcticfox.foo>

	* super.c (unionfs_select_super): return s_root for now

2004-03-15  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@arcticfox.foo>

	* dentry.c (unionfs_d_revalidate): Fix refcounts.

	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): Fix reference counting.

	* inode revalidate "works" (e.g., no Oopses or other broken f/s
	behavior), but has broken reference counting.

2004-03-14  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@arcticfox.foo>

	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): Changed neg_dent_flag to which was
	true if we did *not* have a negative dentry to is_negative_dentry
	which *is* true if we have a negative dentry.  Fixed related
	assert (which was ASSERT(1)).

	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): Read through and simplified lookup by
	removing duplicated code or nasty if/else statements when if
	continue would work(to the tune of 20%).  Clarified comments as
	well.  Now instead of being a 248 line monster it is a 199 line
	monster.

	* UNIONFS-TODO: We still need to solve whiteouts (i.e., you can
	sucessfully stat a whiteout in Unionfs).  Note this is not
	introduced by my changes.

2004-03-12  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_rdwrbranch): Read/write branch setting.

2004-03-11  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* branchman.c (unionfs_ioctl_addbranch): Refcount fix.

2004-03-04  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (do_rename): Correctly check is_readonly.

	* fist.h (print_exit_pointer): Print out pointer using %p and
	don't convert using PTR_ERR if it is not IS_ERR.

	* subr.c (unionfs_create_parent_dir): Return error as pointer

	* subr.c (create_whiteout): Check branch before creating whiteouts.

	* unionfs.h (VALID_MOUNT_FLAGS): Define valid mount flags in the
	header, so main.c doesn't need to know all of them.

	* doit.sh (FLAG): Default mode should be UNLINK_ALL, not
	UNLINK_WHITEOUT.

	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink): Unlink creates whiteout to the left.

2004-03-03  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@polarbear.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): Creation on a robranch will
	cause the file to be created to the left.

	* unionfs.h: More macros for checking if things are on read-only
	branches.

	* xattr.c: Separate xattrs from inode.c.

	* ATTACH-TODO.txt: Unionfs doesn't attach.

	* README.attach: Unionfs doesn't attach.

	* mmap.c: Unionfs doesn't filter data.

	* vm_area.c: No data filtering.

2004-03-02  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c: Updated parsing code so that dirs can be specified as
	b0=rw,b1,b2=ro,b3.  Defaults to rw.  Need to actually integrate
	the permission checking code elsewhere.

2003-11-10  Harikesavan Pathangi Krishnan  <hari@a-rh72i.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_readdir): Changed code to fix the NFS related bug.

2003-10-27  Harikesavan Pathangi Krishnan  <hari@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry_len): This is a modified form of
	unionfs_copyup_dentry() that takes in the length of file to be
	copied up. The length is useful when the file size is changed in
	the setattr.

2003-10-01  Puja Gupta  <puja@t6.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>, Jay, Mohammad.

	* subr.c (unionfs_copyup_dentry): fixed copyup bug, update bstart, bend
	on error on vfs_create.

2003-09-27  Puja Gupta  <puja@a-rh8.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>, Hari, Jay.

	* inode.c (unionfs_rename_all): fixed to call rename and create

	* unionfs.h: modified mount time flags

	* Still left (according to new specs): mkdir, symlink, mknod,
	unlink, rmdir, rename hard.

2003-08-26  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_inode_revalidate): Refresh inode from lower level.

	* fist_ioctl.c: Increment super generation number.

	* file.c (unionfs_ioctl_incgen): Increment super generation number.

2003-08-20  Charles P. Wright  <cwright@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: Branch reference counters updated on open/close.  Need
	to figure out how do to update them when a unionfs directory
	becomes the cwd of a process.

	* doit.sh: Source doitopts or doitopts.`uname -n` so different
	developers can have different setups, w/o changing CVS.

	* unionfs.h: Added generation number to super block, inode, and dentries.

	* attach.c: Not used.

2003-08-13  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c: some fixes in unionfs_copyup_file() (untested yet)

	* file.c: calling unionfs_copyup_file() if write() fails on the
	leftmost file.  Failure could result because of read-only
	permissions on the file so probably should do copy up only if
	branch is mounted RO.

	* unionfs.h: modified definition for unionfs_copyup_file()

2003-08-13  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* subr.c: added function: unionfs_copyup_file(inode_t *dir,
	dentry_t *dentry, int oldbindex, int newbindex) first does
	recursive directory creation, then does vfs_create() and then
	reads PAGE_SIZE bytes from old file to new file

	* subr.c, inode.c: moved useful functions:
	unionfs_create_parent_dir() and unionfs_partial_lookup() to subr.c
	from inode.c

	* unionfs.h: definition for unionfs_copyup_file

	* Makefile: added subr.o to the list of OBJS

2003-08-13  Puja Gupta  <puja@idol.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h: added definition for unionfs_create_whiteout.

2003-08-12  Puja Gupta  <puja@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: reverting back to old copy without changes to rename.

2003-08-04  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h (UNLINK_WHITEOUT, UNLINK_ALL_FIRST, UNLINK_ERR): New flags
	for handling various unlink options.

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): fixed check for getting mount flags.

	* inode.c (unionfs_unlink): added unlink for whiteout. If flag is set
	for UNLINK_WHITEOUT, try to create whiteout in branches to left, create
	recursive subdirectories.  Also added check for various flags for
	unlink_first or unlink_all, and how to handle error on unlink.
	(unionfs_create_parent_dir): check in for loop fixed.

2003-08-04  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: readdir is working fine with the hashtable in the private
	data of unionfs file.
	diff -ru on gcc tarball is successful

	* inode.c: implemented option 2 of link(), recursively creating source
	path in destination branch when branches are different

	* unionfs.h: added two mount time flags
	LINK_EXDEV: just return -EXDEV when dentries are on different branches
	LINK_RECURSIVE: recursively create source path in target branch

2003-07-31  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: readdir/filldir's linked list converted into a hashtable
	of size HASHTABLE_SIZE Duplicate elimation is working. Still to
	test the gcc tarball.

	* unionfs.h: converted dir_list list head to an array of list
	heads of size HASHTABLE_SIZE


2003-07-30  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h: changed to new flag, CREATE_RW_ERR, UNLINK_WHITEOUT,
	UNLINK_ERR.  Function definition for unionfs_partial_lookup.

	* inode.c (unionfs_partial_lookup): added, called from
	unlink. Looks up the remaining files that were not looked up in
	unionfs_lookup.
	(unionfs_unlink): code now transferred to unionfs_partial_lookup.
	(unionfs_create): flag name is CREATE_RW_ERR.

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): changed to new flag values.

	* unionfs.h (IS_SET): changed flags to be exclusive. Also, changed
	IS_SET to work on place value of bit.

2003-07-27  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c (unionfs_open): removed ftohd_index(file, bindex) = NULL.
	unionfs_getdents_callback now has file_t *.
	(unionfs_filldir, unionfs_readdir): changed the global list_head
	for duplicate elimination to have a list_head in private data of
	file. So, the list of name, namelen is stored in this new
	list_head, and compared against this.

	* unionfs.h: added struct filldir_node to private data of file.
	Thus, every file has unique and seperate list for readdir.

	* doit.sh: "flag=" instead of "flags=".

2003-07-28  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c: unionfs_link's option 1 done. Return -EXDEV if old and
	new dentries are in different branches / starting option 2: if
	different branches, creating destination path in the source branch

	* unionfs.h: added a simple function which returns the sum of all
	the underlying inodes' nlink value

	* inode.c: calling the above function wherever nlinks value was
	being set

2003-07-24  Puja Gupta  <puja@t2.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h: #defines for MOUNT_FLAG, CREATE_PASSUP,
	CREATE_RW_ERR_PASSUP, CREATE_TRY_LEFT and IS_SET.

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): parse the mount time flag and
	initialize it.

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): added handling of partial errors to
	handle various cases: 1) Try to Left (default), 2) PassUp, 3) If
	EPERM on RW branch, PassUp.

	* doit.sh: changed mount options to include "flag=".

2003-07-24  Puja Gupta  <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_setattr): added check for NULL hidden dentry.
	(unionfs_inode_revalidate): added ASSERT2 for inode.

2003-07-24  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c: in unionfs_open, now only opening leftmost file instead
	of opening all of the hidden files.  Opening all directories
	though.

	* inode.c: setattr function done. Assigning 'correct' value to the
	n_links variable in the unionfs inode.  In inode_revalidate
	function assigning 'correct' value to the n_links variable in the
	unionfs inode.

	* main.c: just moved sum_nlinks variable to the beginning of the
	  interpose function. diff -ru on a randomly distributed
	  (recursive) gcc tarball is failing. Some duplicate files are
	  being listed.  'ls' on the directory containing above duplicate
	  files also lists the files twice. Files have same unionfs inode.
	  Checking out whats happening.

2003-07-22  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* main.c: in interpose() added lines which compute the sum of the
	nlinks of the underlying inodes and assigns this sum to the
	unionfs inode.

	* inode.c: in permission() added check for a null hidden inode

2003-07-22  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h: init_file_array is now init_ftohf_ptr,
	init_inode_array is now init_itohi_ptr, init_sb_array is now
	init_stohs_ptr, added init_stohiddenmnt_ptr, init_dentry_info,
	init_dentry_array is now init_dtohd_ptr.  All this makes sure that
	all allocated memory is initialized to zero before its being used.

	* super.c (unionfs_read_inode): init_inode_array is now init_itohi_ptr.

	* main.c (unionfs_parse_options): init_priv_inode is now
	init_dentry_info.
	(unionfs_parse_options): memset, init_stohs_ptr, init_stohiddenmnt_ptr
	added for initialize memory allocated to NULL.
	(unionfs_read_super): init_dtohd_ptr added to initialize to NULL.

	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): init_dentry_array is now init_dtohd_ptr.

	* file.c (unionfs_open): added init_ftohf_ptr, setting underlying
	file pointer to NULL.

2003-07-21  Puja Gupta <pugupta@cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): get rid of the hidden dentry that lead
	to an unsuccessful attempt to create. Update bstart, bend
	accordingly.
	(unionfs_create_parent_dir): added "count--" for proper pointer
	position. Updated private data, bstart for the dentry and inode of
	intermediate directories created.  Also, updated bend for the
	negative dentry returned from this function to create.

	* main.c (unionfs_interpose): removed comments and extra line
	spaces.

2003-07-20  Puja Gupta  <puja@idol.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* unionfs.h (MAX_DIR_CREATE): added MAX_DIR_CREATE for the number of
	directories allowed to be created in recursive subdir creation.
	Should be dynamic.

	* inode.c (unionfs_create): changed to handle partial error by
	recursively creating directory to left branches.
	(unionfs_create_parent_dir): added this function, it creates
	hidden directory path for a given parent inode and dentry in
	specified branch. (Still to test)

2003-07-15  Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c <unionfs_lookup>: Found a bug while mounting unionfs on
	a randomly distributed (recursive) am-utils tarball on 5 branches.
	Basically we were not memsetting the array of pointers to hidden
	objects after kmallocing a CUR_MAX_BRANCH number of pointers for
	dentry, inode, file and sb.  They were assumed to be NULL in
	lookup and hence were not explicitly set to NULL in the array when
	requireed.

	* unionfs.h: Added macros which initialize hidden arrays to NULL

2003-07-15  Puja Gupta  <puja@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): added few debug statements.
	(unionfs_unlink): Since lookup for file had just the leftmost
	entry, unlink now internally calls lookup for all remaining
	branches.  And the current policy for unlink is, unlink
	all. (Tested).

	* unionfs.h: added definition for unionfs_reinterpose.

	* main.c (unionfs_reinterpose): This new function takes a dentry
	with leftmost hidden inode interposed, and reinterposes the newly
	lookedup hidden inodes in remaining branches.  Called from
	unionfs_unlink.

	* mount_tarball.sh, mount_tarball_random.sh: These scripts are now
	moved to ../tools directory.

2003-07-13  Puja Gupta  <puja@mooby.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* inode.c (unionfs_lookup): fixed initialization of negative dentry.

	* print.c (fist_print_inode), (fist_print_file),(fist_print_dentry),
	(fist_print_sb): made more readable, pointers now printed with %p.

2003-07-10  Puja Gupta  <puja@idol.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu>

	* super.c (unionfs_statfs): check for duplicate superblock data being
	added.
	(unionfs_umount_begin): check for NULL hidden_sb, hidden_sb->s_op.

2003-07-10 Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* print.c: fist_print_inode(): prints underlying inodes if any.
	fist_print_dentry(): prints underlying dentries if any.
	fist_print_files(): prints underlying files if any.
	fist_print_superblock(): prints underlying sbs if any.

2003-07-10 Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* print.c: improved the formatting of printing inode, dentry and
	sb

	* main.c, inode.c removed unneccessary lines printing debugging
	info in interpose()

2003-07-13 Mohammad Nayyer Zubair <mzubair@ic.sunysb.edu>

	* file.c inode.c: removed debugging info lines

	* created mount_tarball.sh.  right now, distributes an equal
		number of files/dirs among N branches tar-ing am-utils
		through unionfs mount point gives same package buildall
		through mount point gives same structure/files
